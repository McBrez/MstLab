# Introduction
This program has been created as part of the "Mikrosystemtechnik Labor" lecture 
at the "Institut f√ºr Sensor und Aktuator Systeme" TU Wien.
The purpose of this program is to acquire measurement samples, store them in a database and to 
provide a way to configure multiple measurement configurations. The python script "Sentinel.py" implements these requirements. It is supposed to be executed on a Raspberry Pi with an [MCC118](https://www.mccdaq.de/DAQ-HAT/MCC-118.aspx) DAQ extension hat.
The configuration is done in the sentinelConfig.json file. See section "Configuration" for details. 

# Installation
1. Download and install the MCC118 python library from [here](https://www.mccdaq.de/daq-software/DAQ-HAT-Library.aspx).
2. Execute following shell commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
pip3 install RPi.GPIO
```

# Configuration
The behaviour of the script can be configured through the sentinelConfig.json file. The following
shows a valid configuration: 

```json
{
    "DatabaseConfig" : {
        "DatabaseName" : "sentinelDb.sl3",
        "ChangeIntervall" : 100,,
        "WriteIntervall" : 10000
    },
    "MeasurmentConfig" : [
        {
            "ConfigName" : "Config1",
            "Channels" : {
                "0" : "UR1"
            },
            "ScanRate" : 100000,
            "Measurements" : {
                "CurrentShunt" : "UR1"
            },
            "OutputState" : false 
        },
        {
            "ConfigName" : "Config2",
            "Channels" : {
                "0" : "UR3",
                "1" : "UR4"
            },
            "ScanRate" : 50000,
            "Measurements" : {
                "Meas11" : "UR3 - UR4"
            },
            "OutputState" : true 
        }
    ],
    "MeasurementControl" : {
        "MeasConfSwitchTimer" : 10,
        "MeasConfigOutputsGpio" : [29,31,32,33]
    }
} 
```

* DatabaseConfig
	Dictionary containing database specific configuration.

* ChangeIntervall
    The Intervall in write cycles, until the database file gets changed. If set 
    to 0, database files will not get changed.

* DatabaseName
	The base name of the database file, without file ending. The single database
    files will be named in the format DatabaseName_Timestamp.
	
* WriteIntervall
	Interval in Milliseconds, the script shall write back to the database.
	
* MeasurmentConfig
	List containing one or more measurement configurations.

* ConfigName
	The name of the measurement configuration. The name of the SQL table corresponding to this measurement configuration will be derived from this name. The format is <ConfigName>_<MeasurementName>.
 
* Channels
	Dictionary containing the mapping from DAQ channels to tag name. The keys of this dictionary is a string containing a single number (the channel number). The corresponding value is a user defined tag name. 

* ScanRate
	The desired sample rate of the DAQ card.
	
* Measurements
	Dictionary containing the different measurements. The key is the name of the measurement. This name is used in the name of SQL table the measurement values get written to. The format is <ConfigName>_<MeasurementName>. The values of this dictionary contain a mathematical expression, that will be evaluated on each acquired value from the DAQ card. In this expression, the tags defined in the "Channels" dictionary can be used.

* OutputState 
	Defines the state of the GPIOs of the Raspberry Pi, when this measurment configuration is active. 
	
* MeasurementControl
	Dictionary containing measurement control specific configuration.
	
* MeasConfSwitchTimer
	Intervall in seconds, the script shall switch through the measurement configurations.
	
* MeasConfigOutputsGpio
	List that defines the GPIOs that serve as output state. Always has to contain 4 values. Note that there are different port [numbering schemes](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/) on the raspberry pi. In this list, the board numbering scheme is used, rather than the gpio numbering.
	
# Usage 
Just run the following:

```
python3 Sentinel.py 
```

The programm is stopped by hitting STRG+C once.
